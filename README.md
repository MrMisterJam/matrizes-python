## Programs written in Python for solving basic mathematical problems using matrices

This is a practical programming exercise for my Computational Numerical Calculus class.
Here you will find a collection of scripts that solve some basic math problems using matrices.
They run through the terminal and print the states of the equation step by step until it is solved. This is great for checking your results in seconds.
You can solve:
  * Determinant
  * Determinant using Gauss
  * Gauss
  * Gauss-Jordan
  * Transposed Matrix
  * Inverse Matrix
  * Frobenius
  * Condition Number

## How to use

Simply download and put the files containing the programs you want in the same folder, never forgetting the matriz.py, and run via terminal.
